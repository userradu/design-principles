# Design Principles

**Don't make me think**
  - everything should be as simple as possible

**If something is not evident, you need to make is self explanatory**

**A person will *scan* a website and not read everything that is on the page - design for scaning, not reading**
  - when designing a website, don't have in mind an attention to detail user

**People don't choose the best option, they choose the first reasonable option - satisficing**

**People don't read the manual, they muddle through**

**Take advantage of conventions**

**Clarity trumps consistency**
  - if something can be *significantly* clearer by making it *slightly* inconsistent, choose in favor of clarity

**Create effective visual hierarchies** 
  - which things are most important, which things are similar and which things are part of other things
  - the most important things should be more proeminent (large, bolder or in distinctive color, or a the top)
  - similar things should be grouped

**It should be ovbious what is clickable**

**Keep the visual noise down**

**Format your text so it's easier to scan**
  - use headings - they help you decide which parts to read or skip
  - keep paragraphs short
  - highlight key terms - page scannig consists for looking for key words and phrases

**It doesn't matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is mindless**

**Omit needless words**

**Navigating a site is different from navigating a store. You have a sense of direction when you are in a store, you know how you got here... In a website you don't actually navigate, is more like you are being teleported. This is why you need to be constantly reminded where you are**

##Persistent navigation

Should contain the following 4 elements:

**Site ID (logo)**
It should also act as a home button

**Sections**
Links to the main sections of the site.

**Utilities**
Links to important elements that aren't really part of the content hierarchy (ex: sign in, register...)
They shold be slightly less proeminent than the Sections.
The less frequently used leftovers belong in the **footer**

**Search**



**Every page needs a name - it's not enought to highlight the page name in the navigation**

## Breadcrumbs ##
  1. Put them at the top
  2. Use > between levels
  3. Boldface the last item


**The home page needs to convery the big picture: what is this? what can I do here? Where do I start**

**Home page - the welcome blurb(short description)**
  - a short description of the site, displayed in a proeminent block on the Home page, usually at the top left or center of the content space so it's the first thing that catches your eye.
